This is the analysis of a House Prices dataset from the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques." 
As its description states, "with 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, 
this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home."

In the course of this research, I'm going to

- conduct Exploratory Data Analysis;
- build some interactive visualizations;
- prepare data for modeling;
- use ElasticNet and XGBoost regressions to build models, which predict the prices of the houses.
