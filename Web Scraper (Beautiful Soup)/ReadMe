This project was completed as a part of the Natural Language Processing course on JetBrains Academy.

The program takes two parameters from the user input (the number of pages and the type of article). 
Then it goes all over the website and saves every article of the specified type to a separate .txt file on your computer. 
The number of pages from the user input determines how many pages the program should check for the articles.
