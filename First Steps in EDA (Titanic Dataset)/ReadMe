This project is my first attempt to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis. 
For this purpose, I have chosen a dataset from the legendary [Titanic ML competition] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) on Kaggle. 
I am going to make some visualizations and build a correlation matrix in order to understand who had the highest chance to survive on a famous ship.
