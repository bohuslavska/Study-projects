The project was completed as a part of the Natural Language Processing course on JetBrains Academy.

The aim of this project was to learn how to extract key terms from a collection of news stories. While doing this project, I found out how to

- read an XML file and extract the headers and the text;
- tokenize each text;
- lemmatize each word in each story;
- get rid of punctuation, stopwords, and non-nouns with the help of NLTK;
- count the TF-IDF metric for each word in all stories.
