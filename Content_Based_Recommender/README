This project was completed as a part of the Machine Learning Engineer course at an online school for programming, analytics, and data science robot_dreams.

The aim of this project was to build a simple content-based recommender system. While doing this project, I learned how to

- preprocess text with the help of the NLTK library
- vectorize text with the help of CountVectorizer
- apply cosine similarity
