# Topic modeling with the LDA

### About the Project
This project aimed to uncover patterns in a collection of user utterances. The main approach taken was to use topic modeling with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. LDA assumes that "each topic is a mixture over an underlying set of words, and each document is a mixture over a set of topic probabilities." 

### Project Overview
The project utilized LDA to explore the Intertopic Distance Map and the Top-30 Most Salient Terms.
Although the map showed several distinct clusters, it was evident that many ambiguous utterances overlapped with one another.
